# Hackintosh configuration for an Asus Z390i using opencore. 

As backup, because I went and nuked all my previous stuff which is why I switched entirely to opencore.

System specifications:

Asus ROG Strix Z390i ( Wifi Card has been replaced with DW1560 BCM94352Z )

Intel i9-9900k

Powercolor RX580 Red Devil 8GB.

What's Working:
- WiFi
- iMessages
- USB
- Onboard Audio
- Dual Screens through RX580 (DP/HDMI output)

What's not working:

- Bluetooth , which should work with this card.
