# Hackintosh configuration for an Asus Z390i using opencore. 

As backup, because I went and nuked all my previous stuff which is why I switched entirely to opencore.

System specifications:

Asus ROG Strix Z390i ( Wifi Card has been replaced with DW1560 BCM94352Z )
Intel i9-9900k
Powercolor RX580 Red Devil 8GB.

What's not working:

- Wifi and bluetooth, which should work with this card... havent figured that out.
- Audio interfaces on the motherboard.
