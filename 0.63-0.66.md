The original repository was written on 0.63 OC.

Even though OC is currently at 0.6.9, I have seen that probably the biggest issue is going to occur at 0.66, which is why I'm moving to 0.6.6 first before 0.6.9

I have removed the tools portion since it's probably provided in OC, as well as the Bootstrap, since I think it's removed in 0.6.6

I have added by Bootx64, but please don't use the Bootx64 or Opencore.efi, they are meant for my personal backup.

The config.plist is what worked for me.

If you're originally using this repository as a reference when trying to install bigsur on similar hardware and you want to upgrade, I'll just add some notes here.

Here's a little context on my upgrade scenario:

I have dual drives with macos on one drive and windows on another

I don't have any USBs now to use opencore on a bootable installer.

I pretty much just relied on winging it and editing my EFI through windows and then rebooting to try it out.

https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/multiboot/bootstrap.html

This is the most important part of the update to 0.6.6. In the previous config, Bootstrap was enabled. So, we have to get rid of it first before we can use LauncherOptions

Before even using this config, using the previous config, follow step 1, which is to - 

Set Misc -> Security -> AllowNvramReset to True and Misc -> Security -> BootProtect to None, then reset NVRAM (either outside of or in OpenCore) and boot. 
This will get rid of the old Bootstrap boot entry.

This worked really well. a little too well.

At this point, I still wasnt aware of the problem I was facing yet, so I happily went into windows, using  minitool partition wizard and explorer++ to edit my efi files, dropping in the 0.6.6 update files, as well as updating to 0.6.6's config

And then when I rebooted, my bios had no idea about the opencore anymore, so I could only boot into windows - no matter what I tried, I couldn't boot into opencore

So I went back to the guide and I read, but I didn't have a USB, so I couldn't get opencore to boot.

The easiest way is really, to use Hasleo Easy UEFI and simply create a new boot record pointing to your hackintosh EFI dir.

Never thought I'd see the day when Windows saved my ass, but after randomly deciding to upgrade OpenCore at 1am - I'm planning to move to a new GPU soon so I really wanted to get on Big Sur 11.4 I decided I'd at least write this down somewhere so if I get fucked by this again I'll be less likely to forget.
