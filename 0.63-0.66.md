The original repository was written using Opencore 0.6.3

The `config.plist` is what worked for me.

When upgrading beyond OC 0.6.6, I feel that it's better to upgrade first to OC 0.6.6 due to the switch from bootstrap to LauncherOptions.

https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/multiboot/bootstrap.html.

In the previous config.plist posted here, bootstrap was utilised to boot. Thus, when upgrading to 0.6.6, The following needs to be done ( from the above guide )

It is recomended that you use an OpenCore USB drive (or edit the EFI partition from windows on a secondary drive like I did)

Using the previous `config.plist`,
- `Misc -> Security -> AllowNvramReset to True` 
- `Misc -> Security -> BootProtect to None`
- reset NVRAM (I used the resetNVRam option from OpenCore)

This will get rid of the old Bootstrap boot entry.

However, in my case, the motherboard was not able to detect OpenCore after booting.

Using my secondary Windows drive, I then used the following:

- [Minitool Partition Wizard](https://www.minitool.com/partition-manager/partition-wizard-home.html) to mount the EFI volume from my MacOS installation
- [Explorer++](https://explorerplusplus.com/) ran as admin to edit the `config.plist`
- [Hasleo Easy UEFI](https://www.easyuefi.com/) to create a UEFI boot record for my EFI partition.

At this point, the OC 0.6.6 update files can be copied over, together with the updated `config.plist`
